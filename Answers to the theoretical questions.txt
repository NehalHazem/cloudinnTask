1- Given a task in the project you are working on, it’s your first time implementing a feature like this so you search the internet for 
   a solution and you find two open source libraries which could help you implement this task. How would you choose which one to use? 

   I’d choose based on how popular the library is as the more popular it is the more documentations for it and also how
   often it is updated. 


 
2- If there’s one improvement you can add to your favorite programming language or framework, what would that be? 

   I’d make it optional in angular to choose to code using JavaScript or typescript. 


 
3- In a complex financial application, what would be the ideal way to minimize bugs introduced to the system by your own code? 
     
   - Avoid complicated code, the more complicated the code the more likely there ‘ll be bugs. 
   - Using unit testing. 
   - Reread the code to make sure there is nothing missing. 
   - Take compiler warnings as serious as errors. 


 
4- This is the most important question of all, Star Wars or Star Trek? 

   Sorry can’t tell, I have not watched either.
